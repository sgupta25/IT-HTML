	<p>
	One of my favorite movies is Baby Driver. 
	It's about a getaway driver teenager who's always listening to music. He needs to because he has tinnitus <br>
	from the car accident his parents died in when he was young. He's the best at what he does, so he's <br>
	on every job and isn't allowed to stop driving even after he's paid off his debt to a mob boss. It's <br>
	not a long movie, but it's so good from start to finish. It's directed by Edgar Wright, so the <br>
	cinematography really stood out and made the movie even more enjoyable for me.
