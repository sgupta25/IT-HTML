	<p class = "yellow rounded">
	min-width and max-width are used in part to determine aspect ratio and whether something can be shown. <br>
	It allows for the designer to show a different version to mobile devices because they simply don't have <br>
	as much horizontal real estate to show everything. Width is something different entirely, it's where the <br>
	user sets a size for a specific element. 
	</p>
	
	<p class = "yellow shadow">
	The box shadow property is used to provide more contrast between a box and the background it's placed <br>
	on. It is most useful when the box and background are the same light color.
	</p>
	
	<p class = "seethrough">
	The opacity property allows the user to choose how visible/opaque a <br>
	certain element is. This is most useful when the user wants to provide <br> 
	focus to one element and partially hide another.
